Description:  libevdev is a wrapper library for evdev devices. it moves the common
 tasks when dealing with evdev devices into a library and provides a
 library interface to the callers, thus avoiding erroneous ioctls, etc.
 
 The eventual goal is that libevdev wraps all ioctls available to
 evdev devices, thus making direct access unnecessary.
